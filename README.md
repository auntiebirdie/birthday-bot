# Birthday Bot

The Birthday Bot will sit quietly on your server until it's time to celebrate a member's birthday! There are four commands available:

**/birthday** - Allows members to set their birthday.

**/unbirthday** - Allows a member to unset their birthday.

**/check** - Allows members to check another member's birthday.

**/set** - Allows admins to change the announcement channel and time for the server.

You can add this bot to your server for free using [my Ko-Fi Shop](https://ko-fi.com/s/59973339de).
